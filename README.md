# Securities Trading - Python Library

Scripted solutions used in securities trading & Portfolio generation. When applicable references and acknowledgements will be called out in the associated READMEs for each section in this library.

## Description

Personal playground that attempts to use Python and readily available python modules to solve real-life securities trading and portfolio management problems. This library is for educational and entertainment purposes only, I do not advocate their use as a replacement for professional financial advice.


## Prerequisites

There are a number of common and likely a handful of obscure python modules used by these scripts. They will be called out for in the prereq section of each respective script directory.


## Script Threading

As these scripts mature there will be scripts that rely on the existence of support ie ancillary scripts. When this is the case it will be called out in the readme of each respective script directory. When this is the case the directories would need to be kept as the same names and locations as they are present in this repo.
